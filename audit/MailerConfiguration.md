# Elegant Object Audit Report: MailerConfiguration

**File:** `src/Component/Mailer/Configuration/MailerConfiguration.php`  
**Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Overall Compliance Score:** 5.9/10  
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE - Configuration with EO Violations

## Executive Summary

MailerConfiguration demonstrates good private constructor and immutable patterns but suffers from getter method violations and method count issues. Shows configuration builder pattern with some EO compliance issues.

## Detailed Rule Analysis

### 1. Private Constructor with Factory Methods ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Perfect EO constructor pattern
- Private constructor (lines 18-21)
- Factory method `create()` (line 28)

### 2. Attribute Count (1-4 maximum) ⚠️ BORDERLINE COMPLIANCE (6/10)
**Analysis:** At upper limit with uninitialized attributes
- 3 attributes: `$from`, `$attachmentsMaxSize`, `$replyTos`
- Issue: `$from` and `$attachmentsMaxSize` uninitialized in constructor

### 3. Method Naming (Single Verbs) ❌ MAJOR VIOLATION (2/10)
**Analysis:** Multiple getter method violations
- `from()` (line 49) - getter ❌
- `replyTos()` (line 83) - getter ❌
- `attachmentsMaxSize()` (line 102) - getter ❌
- `withFrom()`, `withReplyTo()`, `withReplyTos()`, `withAttachmentsMaxSize()` - compound verbs ❌

### 4. CQRS Separation ❌ MAJOR VIOLATION (3/10)
**Analysis:** Mixed command/query methods
- Commands: `create()`, `with*()` methods
- Queries: `from()`, `replyTos()`, `attachmentsMaxSize()`

### 5. Complete Docblock Coverage ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (5/10)
**Analysis:** `@api` annotations, missing descriptions

### 6. PHPStan Rule Compliance ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (6/10)
**Analysis:** Some issues
- `final` class ✅
- Uninitialized properties issue ⚠️

### 7. Maximum 5 Public Methods ❌ MAJOR VIOLATION (2/10)
**Analysis:** 8 public methods (160% over limit)

### 8. Interface Implementation ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)  
**Analysis:** No interfaces implemented

### 9. Immutable Objects ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (7/10)
**Analysis:** Clone-based immutability with issues
- Uses `clone` for immutable updates
- Direct property mutation in clones

### 10. Composition Over Inheritance ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Perfect composition with framework types

### 11. Configuration Pattern ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (6/10)
**Analysis:** Builder pattern with EO violations

## Configuration Builder Pattern Assessment

### Immutable Builder Implementation
```php
public function withFrom(EmailContact $from): self
{
    $clone = clone $this;
    $clone->from = $from;
    return $clone;
}
```

**Pattern Analysis:**
- ✅ Returns new instance (immutable)
- ❌ Direct property mutation in clone
- ⚠️ Clone-based immutability (functional but not pure EO)

### Uninitialized Attributes Issue
```php
private EmailContact $from;                    // ❌ Uninitialized
private AttachmentMaxSize $attachmentsMaxSize; // ❌ Uninitialized

private function __construct(
    private EmailContactCollection $replyTos,  // ✅ Initialized
) {
}
```

**Problems:**
- Properties declared but not initialized in constructor
- Potential runtime errors if accessed before setting
- Violates fail-fast principles

## Getter Method Anti-Pattern

### Current Violations
```php
// ❌ EO violations - getter methods
public function from(): EmailContact
public function replyTos(): EmailContactCollection  
public function attachmentsMaxSize(): AttachmentMaxSize
```

**Impact:** 3/8 methods are getters (37.5% violation rate)

## EO-Compliant Configuration Alternative

### Strategy Pattern Approach
```php
final readonly class MailerConfiguration
{
    private function __construct(
        private EmailContact $from,
        private EmailContactCollection $replyTos,
        private AttachmentMaxSize $attachmentsMaxSize,
    ) {}
    
    public static function create(
        EmailContact $from,
        EmailContactCollection $replyTos,
        AttachmentMaxSize $attachmentsMaxSize
    ): self {
        return new self($from, $replyTos, $attachmentsMaxSize);
    }
    
    public function configure(MailerService $mailer): void
    {
        $mailer->applyConfiguration($this);
    }
}
```

## Framework Integration Assessment

### Type Composition Excellence
**Framework Types Used:**
- EmailContact (value object)
- EmailContactCollection (type-safe collection)  
- AttachmentMaxSize (value object)

**Benefits:**
- Type-safe configuration
- Framework consistency
- Proper value object composition

## Method Count Analysis

### Method Categories
**Factory (1):** `create()`
**Getters (3):** `from()`, `replyTos()`, `attachmentsMaxSize()`
**Builders (4):** `withFrom()`, `withReplyTo()`, `withReplyTos()`, `withAttachmentsMaxSize()`

**Total: 8 methods = 160% over EO limit**

## Compliance Summary

| Rule Category | Status | Score | Priority |
|---------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Constructor Pattern | ✅ | 10/10 | **Excellent** |
| Attribute Count | ⚠️ | 6/10 | **MEDIUM** |
| Method Naming | ❌ | 2/10 | **HIGH** |
| CQRS Separation | ❌ | 3/10 | **HIGH** |
| Documentation | ⚠️ | 5/10 | **MEDIUM** |
| PHPStan Rules | ⚠️ | 6/10 | **MEDIUM** |
| Method Count | ❌ | 2/10 | **HIGH** |
| Interface Implementation | ✅ | 10/10 | - |
| Immutability | ⚠️ | 7/10 | **MEDIUM** |
| Composition | ✅ | 10/10 | **Excellent** |
| Configuration Pattern | ⚠️ | 6/10 | **MEDIUM** |

## Conclusion

MailerConfiguration demonstrates **good configuration composition** with excellent framework type integration but suffers from significant EO violations due to builder pattern implementation and getter methods.

**Strengths:**
- Perfect private constructor and factory method
- Excellent composition of framework value objects
- Functional immutability with clone-based updates
- Type-safe configuration management
- Good separation of mailer concerns

**Critical Issues:**
- 8 methods (160% over EO limit)
- Getter method anti-pattern (37.5% of methods)
- Uninitialized attributes creating potential runtime issues
- CQRS violations with mixed responsibilities
- Clone-based immutability not pure EO pattern

**Framework Impact:**
- **Configuration Management:** Essential for mailer component setup
- **Type Safety:** Excellent use of framework value objects
- **Builder Pattern:** Functional but not EO-compliant implementation
- **Developer Experience:** Rich configuration API with immutable updates

**Assessment:** The builder pattern inherently conflicts with EO principles - configuration objects need multiple setters/getters for practical use, creating the same tension as Duration/Memory value objects.

**Recommendation:** **MEDIUM PRIORITY** architectural decision - determine if configuration classes should follow strict EO principles or accept violations for builder pattern usability. Consider Strategy pattern alternatives for EO compliance.
