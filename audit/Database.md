    object $object,
): self {
    return new self(
        entityManager: $entityManager,
        object: $object,
    );
}
```

**Command Pattern:**
```php
// ✅ Perfect command methods with fluent interface
public function persist(): self
{
    $this->entityManager->persist($this->object);
    return $this;
}
```

**Wrapper Pattern:**
- Clean abstraction over Doctrine EntityManager
- Simplified interface for framework users
- Type-safe operations

### Documentation Excellence Analysis

**Class-Level Documentation Quality:**

- **Usage Examples:** Both direct and trait-based usage
- **Integration Context:** Shows framework integration patterns
- **Cross-References:** Links to related components

**Method Documentation Quality:**
- **Behavior Description:** Clear explanation of what each method does
- **Technical Details:** Explains when SQL statements execute
- **Return Value Documentation:** Clear return type explanation
- **Framework Context:** Links to Doctrine documentation

### Named Parameter Excellence
```php
// ✅ Consistent named parameter usage
return new self(
    entityManager: $entityManager,
    object: $object,
);
```

This demonstrates framework-wide commitment to readability and clarity.

## Framework Integration Assessment

### Doctrine Abstraction Quality
**Benefits:**
