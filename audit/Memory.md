# Elegant Object Audit Report: Memory

**File:** `src/Common/VO/Memory.php`  
**Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Overall Compliance Score:** 6.4/10  
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE - Value Object with Method Violations

## Executive Summary

Memory demonstrates good private constructor and immutability patterns but suffers from method naming violations and count issues similar to Duration. Shows sophisticated memory calculation functionality but needs EO compliance improvements.

## Detailed Rule Analysis

### 1. Private Constructor with Factory Methods ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Perfect EO constructor pattern
- Private constructor (lines 15-18)
- Factory method `fromBytes()` (line 23)

### 2. Attribute Count (1-4 maximum) ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)  
**Analysis:** Single attribute `$bytes`

### 3. Method Naming (Single Verbs) ❌ MAJOR VIOLATION (2/10)
**Analysis:** Multiple violations
- `asIs()` (line 31) - getter pattern ❌
- `inKilobytes()` (line 39) - compound verb ❌
- `inMegabytes()` (line 47) - compound verb ❌
- `inGigabytes()` (line 55) - compound verb ❌
- `inTerabytes()` (line 63) - compound verb ❌
- `humanReadable()` (line 73) - compound verb ❌
- `equalsTo()` (line 87) - compound verb ❌

### 4. CQRS Separation ❌ MAJOR VIOLATION (2/10)
**Analysis:** All methods are queries

### 5. Complete Docblock Coverage ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (5/10)
**Analysis:** `@api` annotations, missing descriptions

### 6. PHPStan Rule Compliance ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** `final readonly` class, proper types

### 7. Maximum 5 Public Methods ❌ MAJOR VIOLATION (1/10)
**Analysis:** 7 public methods (140% over limit)

### 8. Interface Implementation ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)  
**Analysis:** No interfaces

### 9. Immutable Objects ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Perfect `readonly` immutability

### 10. Composition Over Inheritance ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Uses framework Collection

### 11. Domain-Specific Functionality ✅ GOOD (8/10)
**Analysis:** Sophisticated memory operations

## Memory Calculation Excellence

### Conversion Methods
```php
public function inKilobytes(): float
{
    return $this->bytes / self::KB;
}
```

**Same pattern as Duration** - multiple unit conversions.

### Human-Readable Formatting
```php
public function humanReadable(): string
{
    $units = Collection::of(['B', 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB']);
    // Sophisticated unit selection logic
}
```

**Framework Integration:** Uses Collection for unit management.

## Same EO Issues as Duration

Memory has **identical EO violations** to Duration:
- Method count violation (7 vs 5 limit)
- Getter method anti-pattern
- All methods are queries
- Compound verb naming

## Compliance Summary

| Rule Category | Status | Score |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Constructor Pattern | ✅ | 10/10 |
| Attribute Count | ✅ | 10/10 |
| Method Naming | ❌ | 2/10 |
| CQRS Separation | ❌ | 2/10 |
| Documentation | ⚠️ | 5/10 |
| PHPStan Rules | ✅ | 10/10 |
| Method Count | ❌ | 1/10 |
| Interface Implementation | ✅ | 10/10 |
| Immutability | ✅ | 10/10 |
| Composition | ✅ | 10/10 |
| Domain Functionality | ✅ | 8/10 |

## Conclusion

Memory demonstrates the **same architectural challenge as Duration** - sophisticated value object with excellent core patterns but EO violations in method design.

**Recommendation:** **SAME AS DURATION** - architectural decision needed for conversion-heavy value objects.
