# Elegant Object Audit Report: MutableException

**File:** `src/Common/Exception/MutableException.php`  
**Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Overall Compliance Score:** 7.8/10  
**Status:** ✅ MOSTLY COMPLIANT - Enhanced Exception Pattern

## Executive Summary

The MutableException class follows the established framework exception pattern while adding domain-specific factory methods. It demonstrates good adherence to Elegant Object principles with minor violations in method naming. The class provides focused functionality for immutability violations in the framework.

## Detailed Rule Analysis

### 1. Private Constructor with Factory Methods ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Excellent factory method implementation
- Standard factory methods via ThrowableTrait (`new()`, `fromThrowable()`)
- Domain-specific factory: `becauseMustBeImmutable()` (line 13)
- Controlled instantiation through static factory methods

### 2. Attribute Count (1-4 maximum) ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)  
**Analysis:** Standard exception attributes through inheritance
- Inherits 3 attributes from \RuntimeException (message, code, previous)
- Perfect compliance within 1-4 range

### 3. Method Naming (Single Verbs) ❌ MINOR VIOLATION (6/10)
**Analysis:** Mixed compliance with enhanced factory method

**Violations:**
- `becauseMustBeImmutable()` (line 13) - long descriptive name, violates single-verb rule

**Compliant Methods (via Trait):**
- `new()`, `throw()` - single verbs
- `fromThrowable()`, `withPrevious()` - acceptable patterns

**Analysis:** Domain-specific factory adds descriptive value but violates naming convention

### 4. CQRS Separation ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Perfect command/query separation
- All methods are commands (factory methods creating instances, throw method)
- Clear side effects and return types
- No mixed command/query patterns

### 5. Complete Docblock Coverage ❌ MAJOR VIOLATION (3/10)
**Analysis:** Missing documentation for domain-specific method

**Missing Documentation:**
- `becauseMustBeImmutable()` (line 13) - no docblock explaining purpose
- Method lacks explanation of when/why to use
- No usage examples for domain-specific scenario

**Present Documentation:**
- ThrowableTrait methods are well documented

### 6. PHPStan Rule Compliance ✅ EXCELLENT (9/10)
**Analysis:** Strong compliance with minor method naming issue
- Proper inheritance, interface implementation, trait composition
- No static methods except factories
- Strict typing, appropriate exception hierarchy

### 7. Maximum 5 Public Methods ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Well within limits
- 5 methods total: 4 from trait + 1 domain-specific
- Exactly at the maximum limit but compliant

### 8. Interface Implementation ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)  
**Analysis:** Single focused interface (ThrowableInterface)

### 9. Immutable Objects ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Perfect immutability via trait implementation
- `becauseMustBeImmutable()` returns new instance (line 15)

### 10. Domain-Specific Enhancement ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Focused domain responsibility
- Specific purpose: handling immutability violations
- Provides contextual factory method for specific use case
- Enhances framework's immutability enforcement

### 11. Final Declaration ⚠️ MINOR IMPROVEMENT (8/10)
**Issue:** Class should be declared `final` to prevent inheritance

## Enhanced Exception Pattern Analysis

### Pattern Evolution
This class demonstrates an **enhanced version** of the framework exception pattern:
```php
[final] class DomainException extends \StandardException implements ThrowableInterface
{
    use ThrowableTrait;
    
    // Domain-specific factory methods
    public static function becauseSpecificReason(): self
    {
        return self::new('Specific contextual message.');
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Enhancement
- **Contextual Creation:** `becauseMustBeImmutable()` provides clear context
- **Framework Integration:** Enforces framework's immutability principles
- **Developer Experience:** Descriptive factory method names improve clarity
- **Type Safety:** Returns specific exception type with appropriate message

### Trade-offs Analysis
**Benefits:**
- Clear domain context and purpose
- Improved developer experience with descriptive names
- Framework-specific functionality enhancement

**EO Compliance Issues:**
- Long method name violates single-verb principle
- Descriptive naming conflicts with EO minimalism
- Potential method count growth with multiple domain factories

## Comparison with Standard Exception Pattern

| Aspect | MutableException | Standard Pattern | Assessment |
|--------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| Base Structure | ✅ Same | ✅ ThrowableTrait + Interface | Consistent |
| Domain Enhancement | ✅ Added factory | ❌ No domain methods | Enhanced functionality |
| Method Count | ⚠️ 5 methods (at limit) | ✅ 4 methods | At boundary |
| Naming Compliance | ❌ Long domain method | ✅ Standard names | Trade-off issue |
| Documentation | ❌ Missing domain docs | ✅ Via trait | Needs improvement |

## Framework Design Philosophy Tension

### Elegant Object vs Domain Clarity
This class highlights a **design philosophy tension**:

**EO Principle:** Single-verb method names  
**Domain Clarity:** `becauseMustBeImmutable()` clearly expresses purpose

**Framework Decision:** Appears to prioritize domain clarity over strict EO naming

### Consistency Assessment
Need to evaluate if this enhancement pattern is:
1. **Framework Standard:** Used across domain-specific exceptions
2. **One-off Pattern:** Unique to this exception
3. **Emerging Pattern:** Being adopted selectively

## Refactoring Recommendations

### Option 1: Strict EO Compliance
```php
// Rename to single verb
public static function immutable(): self
{
    return self::new('Must be immutable.');
}
```

### Option 2: Documentation Enhancement (Recommended)
```php
/**
 * Creates exception for immutability violations.
 * 
 * Used when an operation attempts to mutate an immutable object
 * in violation of framework's immutability principles.
 * 
 * @return self Exception with contextual immutability message
 */
public static function becauseMustBeImmutable(): self
{
    return self::new('Must be immutable.');
}
```

### Option 3: Compromise Approach
```php
/**
 * Creates exception for immutability violations.
 */
public static function immutableViolation(): self
{
    return self::new('Must be immutable.');
}
```

## Framework-wide Implications

### Pattern Decision Required
The framework needs to decide on:
1. **Naming Strategy:** Strict EO vs domain clarity
2. **Documentation Requirements:** Enhanced docs for domain methods
3. **Pattern Consistency:** Apply same approach to all domain exceptions

### Recommendation
**Maintain current approach** but **enhance documentation**:
- Domain-specific factories provide valuable context
- Documentation can bridge EO compliance gap
- Consistent application across framework exceptions

## Compliance Summary

## Conclusion

MutableException demonstrates an **enhanced exception pattern** that balances Elegant Object principles with domain-specific functionality. While it has minor violations in method naming and documentation, it provides valuable framework functionality for immutability enforcement.

**Strengths:**
- Clear domain purpose and functionality
- Excellent structural compliance with EO principles
- Enhanced developer experience through contextual factories
- Perfect immutability and CQRS implementation

**Improvements Needed:**
- Add comprehensive documentation for domain method
- Consider final declaration for consistency
- Evaluate naming strategy across framework

**Assessment:** This represents a **thoughtful evolution** of the standard exception pattern, prioritizing domain clarity while maintaining structural EO compliance.

**Recommendation:** **Low priority** for changes. Focus on documentation enhancement and consider this pattern for other domain-specific exceptions in the framework.
