# Elegant Object Audit Report: ContextFactory

**File:** `src/Common/Factory/Context/ContextFactory.php`  
**Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Overall Compliance Score:** 6.4/10  
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE - Factory Pattern with EO Violations

## Executive Summary

ContextFactory demonstrates good factory pattern implementation but violates several core Elegant Object principles, primarily the private constructor rule and method naming conventions. While functionally effective, it requires significant refactoring to achieve full EO compliance.

## Detailed Rule Analysis

### 1. Private Constructor with Factory Methods ❌ MAJOR VIOLATION (2/10)
**Analysis:** Public constructor violates core EO principle
- **Line 16-20:** Public constructor accepting dependencies
- **Missing:** Static factory methods for object creation
- **Impact:** Allows direct instantiation bypassing controlled creation

**EO Violation:**
```php
// ❌ VIOLATION: Public constructor
public function __construct(
    private SecurityInterface $security,
    private ClockInterface $clock,
) {
}
```

**Expected EO Pattern:**
```php
// ✅ COMPLIANT: Private constructor + factory method
private function __construct(
    private readonly SecurityInterface $security,
    private readonly ClockInterface $clock,
) {}

public static function new(SecurityInterface $security, ClockInterface $clock): self
{
    return new self($security, $clock);
}
```

### 2. Attribute Count (1-4 maximum) ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)  
**Analysis:** Within acceptable range
- 2 attributes: `$security`, `$clock`
- Well within 1-4 attribute limit
- Appropriate dependency injection pattern

### 3. Method Naming (Single Verbs) ❌ MAJOR VIOLATION (3/10)
**Analysis:** Multiple method naming violations

**Violating Methods:**
- `fromUser()` (line 27) - compound verb phrase ❌
- `fromDateTime()` (line 39) - compound verb phrase ❌

**Compliant Methods:**
- `create()` (line 51) - single verb ✅

**EO Violation Impact:**
Method names don't follow single-verb requirement, reducing code expressiveness and EO compliance.

### 4. CQRS Separation ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)
**Analysis:** All methods are commands
- All methods return new ContextInterface instances
- Clear command pattern throughout
- No mixed command/query behavior

### 5. Complete Docblock Coverage ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (6/10)
**Analysis:** Inconsistent documentation

**Present Documentation:**
- Method-level docblocks for all public methods
- `@throws` annotations present
- `@api` annotations for public interface

**Missing Documentation:**
- Class-level documentation explaining purpose
- Parameter documentation for all methods
- Return type descriptions
- Usage examples and context

### 6. PHPStan Rule Compliance ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Good compliance with static analysis rules
- Proper type declarations
- `final readonly` class declaration (excellent)
- Correct interface usage
- Type-safe method signatures

### 7. Maximum 5 Public Methods ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Well within limits
- 3 public methods total
- Each method has distinct responsibility
- Appropriate API surface area

### 8. Interface Implementation ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)  
**Analysis:** No interfaces implemented (factory pattern appropriate)
- Factory classes don't typically implement domain interfaces
- Correct architectural choice

### 9. Immutable Objects ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (7/10)
**Analysis:** Mixed immutability implementation
- **Good:** `final readonly` class declaration prevents inheritance and modification
- **Issue:** Public constructor allows external instantiation without control
- **Assessment:** Functionally immutable but structurally non-compliant

### 10. Composition Over Inheritance ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Perfect dependency injection pattern
- Uses composition for SecurityInterface and ClockInterface
- No inheritance hierarchies
- Clean dependency management

### 11. Factory Pattern Implementation ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (7/10)
**Analysis:** Good factory functionality with structural issues
- **Good:** Creates Context objects through delegation
- **Good:** Multiple creation paths (`fromUser`, `fromDateTime`, `create`)
- **Issue:** EO violations reduce pattern quality

## Factory Pattern Assessment

### Current Implementation Strengths
**Functional Excellence:**
- Clear factory responsibility separation
- Multiple creation pathways for different scenarios
- Proper dependency injection for external services
- Type-safe Context creation

**Architectural Benefits:**
- Centralizes Context creation logic
- Abstracts complexity from consumers
- Proper separation of concerns

### EO Compliance Issues

**Critical Violations:**
1. **Public Constructor:** Violates core EO principle
2. **Method Naming:** `fromUser`, `fromDateTime` use compound verbs

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Functionality:** No impact - factory works correctly
- **EO Compliance:** Significant violations reduce overall score
- **Framework Consistency:** Deviates from framework EO patterns

## Framework Pattern Analysis

### Factory Pattern in Framework Context
**Current Pattern:**
```php
// ❌ Non-EO compliant but functional
$factory = new ContextFactory($security, $clock);
$context = $factory->fromUser($user);
```

**EO-Compliant Alternative:**
```php
// ✅ EO compliant factory pattern
$factory = ContextFactory::new($security, $clock);
$context = $factory->from($user);
// or
$context = $factory->create($user, $clock->now());
```

### Method Naming Refactoring

**Current vs. EO-Compliant:**
| Current | EO-Compliant | Assessment |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| `fromUser()` | `from()` + overloading | Single verb compliance |
| `fromDateTime()` | `create()` + explicit params | Remove compound verbs |
| `create()` | ✅ Compliant | Already perfect |

## Refactoring Recommendations

### 1. Private Constructor Implementation
```php
// Priority: HIGH
private function __construct(
    private readonly SecurityInterface $security,
    private readonly ClockInterface $clock,
) {}

public static function new(SecurityInterface $security, ClockInterface $clock): self
{
    return new self($security, $clock);
}
```

### 2. Method Naming Refactoring
```php
// Priority: MEDIUM
public function from(UserInterface $user): ContextInterface
{
    $dateTime = $this->clock->now();
    return $this->create($user, $dateTime);
}

public function create(UserInterface $user, \DateTimeInterface $dateTime): ContextInterface
{
    return Context::create($user, $dateTime);
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Documentation
```php
/**
 * Factory for creating Context objects with proper dependency injection.
 * 
 * Centralizes Context creation logic and abstracts complexity from consumers.
 */
final readonly class ContextFactory
```

## Framework Integration Impact

### Dependency Injection Considerations
**Current Pattern:** Constructor injection (standard Symfony pattern)
**EO Requirement:** Private constructor with factory methods
**Resolution Strategy:** Framework-level factory registration

### Breaking Change Assessment
**Impact Level:** MEDIUM
- Public constructor currently used by DI container
- Requires framework configuration changes
- Consumer code may need updates

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Add static factory methods alongside constructor
2. Update DI configuration to use factory methods
3. Deprecate public constructor
4. Remove public constructor in next major version

## Conclusion

ContextFactory demonstrates good factory pattern implementation with clear functional benefits but requires significant refactoring to achieve Elegant Object compliance. The violations are structural rather than functional, making this a good candidate for systematic refactoring.

**Strengths:**
- Clear factory responsibility and pattern implementation
- Good dependency injection and composition patterns
- Type-safe Context creation with multiple pathways
- `final readonly` class declaration

**Critical Issues:**
- Public constructor violates core EO principle
- Method naming uses compound verbs instead of single verbs
- Missing comprehensive documentation

**Assessment:** Good functional factory requiring **medium-priority EO compliance refactoring**. The factory pattern is sound but needs structural improvements for framework consistency.

**Recommendation:** **Medium priority** refactoring focusing on private constructor implementation and method naming compliance. Consider as part of framework-wide EO compliance initiative.
