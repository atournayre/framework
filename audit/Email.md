# Elegant Object Audit Report: Email

**File:** `src/Component/Mailer/VO/Email.php`  
**Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Overall Compliance Score:** 3.9/10  
**Status:** ❌ POOR COMPLIANCE - Complex VO with Major EO Violations

## Executive Summary

Email demonstrates sophisticated email composition and validation but suffers from catastrophic method count violations (19 methods), extensive getter anti-patterns, and builder pattern conflicts with EO principles. Shows rich domain modeling at the cost of EO compliance.

## Detailed Rule Analysis

### 1. Private Constructor with Factory Methods ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (6/10)
**Analysis:** Protected constructor with factory method
- **Protected Constructor:** Line 21 - not private but controlled
- **Factory Method:** `create()` (line 42) with essential parameters
- **PHPStan Suppression:** Line 44 suggests inheritance complexity

### 2. Attribute Count (1-4 maximum) ❌ CATASTROPHIC VIOLATION (1/10)
**Analysis:** **10 attributes** - 250% over EO limit
- Complex email composition with multiple collections and types
- All essential for email functionality but violates EO severely

### 3. Method Naming (Single Verbs) ❌ CATASTROPHIC VIOLATION (1/10)
**Analysis:** Extensive getter method violations
- **9 getter methods:** `subject()`, `from()`, `to()`, `cc()`, `bcc()`, `replyTo()`, `attachments()`, `text()`, `html()`, `tags()`
- **9 with methods:** All use compound verbs (`withTo`, `withCc`, etc.)
- **Assessment:** 18/19 methods violate EO naming (95% violation rate)

### 4. CQRS Separation ❌ CATASTROPHIC VIOLATION (1/10)
**Analysis:** Mixed command/query responsibilities
- **Queries:** All getter methods, `validate()`, `isValid()`, `toLog()`
- **Commands:** `create()`, all `with*()` methods
- **Severe mixing** of responsibilities

### 5. Complete Docblock Coverage ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (5/10)
**Analysis:** `@api` annotations throughout, missing descriptions

### 6. PHPStan Rule Compliance ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (5/10)
**Analysis:** PHPStan suppression indicates issues
- Line 44 suppression in factory method
- Non-final class (inheritance intended)

### 7. Maximum 5 Public Methods ❌ CATASTROPHIC VIOLATION (1/10)
**Analysis:** **19 public methods** (380% over EO limit)
- Worst violation seen in framework so far
- Complex builder pattern requires extensive API

### 8. Interface Implementation ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (6/10)  
**Analysis:** Two interfaces - acceptable for complex VO
- LoggableInterface, TypeValidationInterface

### 9. Immutable Objects ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (6/10)
**Analysis:** Clone-based immutability with issues
- Uses `clone` for updates (functional immutability)
- Direct property mutation in clones

### 10. Composition Over Inheritance ✅ GOOD (8/10)
**Analysis:** Excellent framework type composition
- Composes all email-related value objects and collections

### 11. Email Domain Modeling ✅ EXCEPTIONAL (10/10)
**Analysis:** Outstanding email domain representation

## Email Domain Excellence

### Comprehensive Email Composition
```php
protected function __construct(
    private readonly EmailSubject $subject,
    private readonly EmailContact $from,
    private EmailContactCollection $to,
    private EmailContactCollection $cc,
    private EmailContactCollection $bcc,
    private EmailContactCollection $replyTo,
    private FileCollection $attachments,
    private TagCollection $tags,
    private EmailText $text,
    private EmailHtml $html,
) {
}
```

**Domain Completeness:**
- All essential email components
- Type-safe composition throughout
- Framework collection integration
- Proper separation of concerns

### Email Validation Excellence
```php
public function validate(): ValidationCollection
{
    return ValidationCollection::asMap([])
        ->set('to', 'validation.email.to.empty', fn () => $this->to->hasNoElement()->isTrue());
}
```

**Validation Benefits:**
- Framework ValidationCollection integration
- Business rule validation (requires recipients)
- Type-safe validation results

### Builder Pattern Implementation
```php
public function withTo(EmailContactCollection $to): self
{
    $clone = clone $this;
    $clone->to = $to;
    return $clone;
}
```

**Pattern Analysis:**
- ✅ Immutable updates (returns new instance)
- ❌ Clone-based immutability (not pure EO)
- ✅ Type-safe parameter handling
- ❌ Compound verb naming

## Framework Integration Excellence

### Type System Integration
**Framework Types Used:**
- EmailSubject, EmailContact, EmailText, EmailHtml
- EmailContactCollection, TagCollection, FileCollection
- ValidationCollection, BoolEnum

**Integration Quality:** Perfect framework type composition

### Logging Integration
```php
public function toLog(): array
{
    return [
        'subject' => $this->subject->toString(),
        'from' => $this->from->toLog(),
        // ... comprehensive logging data
    ];
}
```

**Logging Excellence:**
- Comprehensive email data logging
- Delegated logging to component types
- Framework LoggableInterface compliance

## EO Compliance Crisis

### Method Count Analysis
**19 methods breakdown:**
- Factory: `create()` (1)
- Getters: 9 methods
- Builders: 8 `with*()` methods  
- Validation: `validate()`, `isValid()` (2)
- Logging: `toLog()` (1)

**Assessment:** Email inherently needs extensive API for practical use.

### Builder vs EO Conflict
**Builder Pattern Requirements:**
- Multiple `with*()` methods for email composition
- Getter methods for component access
- Rich API for email construction

**EO Requirements:**
- Maximum 5 methods
- Single-verb naming
- Private constructor

**Fundamental Incompatibility:** Builder pattern conflicts with EO principles.

## Email Domain vs EO Tension

### Domain Modeling Excellence
**Email Requirements:**
- Multiple recipients (to, cc, bcc)
- Content types (text, html)
- Attachments and metadata
- Validation and logging

**Implementation Quality:**
- World-class domain modeling
- Type-safe composition
- Comprehensive validation
- Framework integration

### EO Compliance Costs
**Strict EO Would Require:**
- Eliminating 14 methods (keeping only 5)
- Removing all getters
- Single-verb method names only
- Private constructor

**Impact:** Would destroy practical email utility.

## Framework Architecture Challenge

### Email as Aggregate Root
**Domain Modeling:** Email is a complex aggregate requiring rich API
**EO Principles:** Demand simple objects with minimal methods
**Conflict:** Rich aggregates cannot comply with strict EO limits

### Framework Pattern Comparison

| Component | EO Score | Methods | Domain Complexity |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Email** | **3.9/10** | **19** | **High** |
| MailerConfiguration | 5.9/10 | 8 | Medium |
| EmailAddress | 6.9/10 | 8 | Medium |
| Duration | 6.1/10 | 8 | Medium |
| Uri | 4.8/10 | 17 | High |

Email shows **lowest EO compliance** due to highest domain complexity.

## Compliance Summary

| Rule Category | Status | Score | Priority |
|---------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Constructor Pattern | ⚠️ | 6/10 | **MEDIUM** |
| Attribute Count | ❌ | 1/10 | **CRITICAL** |
| Method Naming | ❌ | 1/10 | **CRITICAL** |
