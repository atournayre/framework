# Elegant Object Audit Report: EmailContactCollection

**File:** `src/Component/Mailer/Collection/EmailContactCollection.php`  
**Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Overall Compliance Score:** 7.6/10  
**Status:** ✅ GOOD COMPLIANCE - Collection with Additional Features

## Executive Summary

EmailContactCollection demonstrates good EO compliance with factory methods, validation, and additional domain operations. Shows similar patterns to EmailAddressCollection with enhanced functionality for logging and searching.

## Detailed Rule Analysis

### 1. Private Constructor with Factory Methods ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (8/10)
**Analysis:** Factory method present but missing private constructor
- Factory method: `asList()` (line 23)
- Uses CollectionTrait constructor

### 2. Attribute Count (1-4 maximum) ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)  
**Analysis:** Uses trait-based attribute management

### 3. Method Naming (Single Verbs) ⚠️ BORDERLINE COMPLIANCE (6/10)
**Analysis:** Mixed compliance
- `asList()` - acceptable factory pattern ✅
- `toLog()` - compound verb ❌
- `contains()` - single verb ✅

### 4. CQRS Separation ❌ MAJOR VIOLATION (4/10)
**Analysis:** Mixed command/query methods
- Commands: `asList()` (factory)
- Queries: `toLog()`, `contains()`

### 5. Complete Docblock Coverage ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (6/10)
**Analysis:** Good parameter documentation, missing class description

### 6. PHPStan Rule Compliance ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** `final` class, proper type declarations

### 7. Maximum 5 Public Methods ✅ COMPLIANT (10/10)
**Analysis:** 3 additional methods plus trait methods

### 8. Interface Implementation ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE (7/10)  
**Analysis:** Two focused interfaces
- LoggableInterface, AsListInterface

### 9. Immutable Objects ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Inherits immutability from CollectionTrait

### 10. Composition Over Inheritance ✅ EXCELLENT (10/10)
**Analysis:** Perfect trait composition

### 11. Domain Operations ✅ GOOD (8/10)
**Analysis:** Useful domain-specific operations
- Logging integration
- Collection search functionality

## Collection Enhancement Assessment

### Logging Integration
```php
public function toLog(): array
{
    return $this->collection
        ->map(fn (EmailContact $emailContact) => $emailContact->toLog())
        ->toArray();
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Framework logging integration
- Type-safe log transformation
- Delegated logging responsibility

### Search Functionality
```php
public function contains($key, ?string $operator = null, $value = null): BoolEnum
{
    return $this->collection->contains($key, $operator, $value);
}
```

**Features:**
- Flexible search parameters
- Framework BoolEnum return
- Delegates to Collection implementation

## Framework Pattern Comparison

### Collection Design Evolution

| Collection | EO Score | Factory Methods | Additional Features |
|------------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| EmailAddressCollection | 8.1/10 | ✅ Multiple | ❌ Basic |
| **EmailContactCollection** | **7.6/10** | ⚠️ **Single** | ✅ **Logging + Search** |

EmailContactCollection adds useful features but fewer factory methods.

## Type Safety Assessment

### EmailContact Validation
```php
public static function asList(array $collection): self
{
    Assert::isListOf($collection, EmailContact::class);
    return new self(Collection::of($collection));
}
```

**Same excellent pattern** as EmailAddressCollection with type validation.

## Missing Features Compared to EmailAddressCollection

### Additional Factory Methods
```php
// Missing from EmailContactCollection
public static function asMap(array $collection): self
public static function fromArray(array $contacts): self
```

**Assessment:** EmailContactCollection has fewer factory options than EmailAddressCollection.

## Compliance Summary

| Rule Category | Status | Score | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|-------|
| Constructor Pattern | ⚠️ | 8/10 | Factory method, missing private constructor |
| Attribute Count | ✅ | 10/10 | Trait-based management |
| Method Naming | ⚠️ | 6/10 | `toLog()` compound verb |
| CQRS Separation | ❌ | 4/10 | **Mixed responsibilities** |
| Documentation | ⚠️ | 6/10 | Good parameters, missing class docs |
| PHPStan Rules | ✅ | 10/10 | Perfect compliance |
| Method Count | ✅ | 10/10 | Well within limits |
| Interface Implementation | ⚠️ | 7/10 | Two focused interfaces |
| Immutability | ✅ | 10/10 | **Perfect trait immutability** |
| Composition | ✅ | 10/10 | **Excellent framework integration** |
| Domain Operations | ✅ | 8/10 | **Useful additional features** |

## Conclusion

EmailContactCollection represents **good collection design** with useful domain operations but slightly lower EO compliance than EmailAddressCollection due to mixed command/query responsibilities.

**Strengths:**
- Type-safe factory method with EmailContact validation
- Excellent framework integration (Assert, Collection, BoolEnum)
- Useful domain operations (logging, search)
- Perfect trait composition and immutability
- Good additional functionality beyond basic collection

**Issues:**
- Missing private constructor
- CQRS violation with mixed responsibilities  
- `toLog()` method uses compound verb
- Fewer factory methods than EmailAddressCollection

**Framework Impact:**
- **Domain Enhancement:** Adds useful logging and search capabilities
- **Framework Integration:** Good use of LoggableInterface
- **Type Safety:** Maintains excellent EmailContact validation
- **Collection Standards:** Slightly lower than EmailAddressCollection

**Assessment:** Good EO compliance with valuable domain enhancements. Shows framework collections can provide additional functionality while maintaining good EO patterns.

**Recommendation:** **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - add private constructor, consider method naming improvements, and potentially add more factory methods to match EmailAddressCollection patterns.
