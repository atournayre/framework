# ADR 0007: HTTP/Session/Templating

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In our project, we need to handle HTTP requests, manage sessions, and render templates.

## Decision
We have decided to create interfaces to decouple the HTTP, session, and templating logic from the rest of the application.

We will create the following interfaces:
- `ResponseInterface` to provide methods for handling HTTP responses.
- `RoutingInterface` to define methods for routing HTTP requests.
- `FlashBagInterface` to manage flash messages in sessions.
- `TemplatingInterface` to define methods for rendering templates.

We will also create the following classes to implement the interfaces for Symfony:
- `ResponseService` to handle HTTP responses.
- `RoutingService` to route HTTP requests.
- `FlashBagService` to manage flash messages in sessions.
- `TwigTemplatingService` to render templates using Twig.

### Implementation Details
1. **ResponseInterface**:
    - Provides methods for handling HTTP responses.
    - Requires implementing classes to provide methods for setting headers, content, and status codes.
2. **RoutingInterface**:
    - Defines methods for routing HTTP requests.
    - Requires implementing classes to provide methods for matching routes and handling requests.
3. **FlashBagInterface**:
    - Manages flash messages in sessions.
    - Requires implementing classes to provide methods for adding, retrieving, and clearing flash messages.
4. **TemplatingInterface**:
    - Renders templates.
    - Requires implementing classes to provide methods for rendering templates with variables.
    - May include methods for extending templates, including partials, and managing template inheritance.
5. **ResponseService**:
    - Implements the `ResponseInterface` for Symfony.
    - Provides methods for setting headers, content, and status codes in Symfony responses.
6. **RoutingService**:
    - Implements the `RoutingInterface` for Symfony.
    - Matches routes and handles requests in Symfony applications.
7. **FlashBagService**:
    - Implements the `FlashBagInterface` for managing flash messages in Symfony sessions.
    - Provides methods for adding, retrieving, and clearing flash messages.
    - May include methods for setting flash message types (e.g., success, error).
    - May include methods for displaying flash messages in templates.
8. **TwigTemplatingService**:
    - Implements the `TemplatingInterface` for rendering templates using Twig.
    - Provides methods for rendering templates with variables.
    - Includes methods for extending templates, including partials, and managing template inheritance.

## Consequences

- **Benefits**:
    - Decouples HTTP, session, and templating logic from the rest of the application.
    - Provides a consistent and reusable approach to handling HTTP requests, managing sessions, and rendering templates.
    - Enhances code readability and maintainability by separating concerns.
    - Facilitates testing by providing interfaces for mocking HTTP, session, and templating behavior.
    - Allows for easy integration with Symfony components and services.
    - Enables flexibility in choosing different implementations for HTTP, session, and templating services.
    - Promotes code reusability and modularity by using interfaces and service classes.
    - Improves scalability and maintainability by separating concerns and responsibilities.

- **Drawbacks**:
    - Introduces additional complexity with the need to create and manage the interfaces and service classes.
    - Requires developers to be familiar with the interfaces and classes for HTTP, session, and templating services.
    - May require additional configuration for custom implementations of the services.
    - Potential issues with compatibility or conflicts with existing Symfony components or services.
    - Possible performance overhead from using interfaces and service classes for HTTP, session, and templating logic.
    - Increased learning curve for developers new to the project or Symfony framework.
    - Dependency on Symfony components for implementing the services may limit portability to other frameworks or platforms.
    - Potential challenges in maintaining and updating the interfaces and service classes as Symfony evolves.
    - Risk of inconsistencies or discrepancies between the interfaces and service implementations.
    - Difficulty in debugging or troubleshooting issues related to HTTP, session, or templating services due to abstraction and encapsulation.
    - Limited flexibility in changing or extending the behavior of the services without modifying the interfaces or service classes.
